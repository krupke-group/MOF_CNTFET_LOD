# MOF_CNTFET_LOD
- the jupyter notebook relates to the publication of Kumar et al., XXX (doi:YYY)
- first, the concentration values of Table 2 is calculated based on the parameters a and b from Table 1
- next, interpolation functions are fitted to the tau-dependent parameters a and b
- then, these functions are used to calculate deltaG/G versus concentration and tau
- finally, the data is plotted as a heatmap with contour lines and used reproduced as Figure_X in the publication.
