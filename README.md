- the jupyter notebook relates to the publication of Kumar et al., Adv. Electron. Mater. 2023, 2300533 (doi:10.1002/aelm.202300533):
- the concentration values of Table 2 are calculated based on the parameters a and b from Table 1
- interpolation functions are fitted to the tau-dependent parameters a and b
- these functions are used to calculate deltaG/G versus concentration and tau
- the data is plotted as a heatmap with contour lines and used as Figure_X in the publication
